# Madcamp_first
2019 Fall KAIST  

## Description  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This repository is for madcamp project of first week.  
In this project, we make an android application with three tabs.  
Each tab has its own content respectively: Address book, Photo gallery, Undecided content.  
Below is explanation for tabs.  
#### Tab1  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tab is for address book. We implemented it as getting all phone numbers and names, and show them.
Implementing, we used ListView, and adapter to show the contents. To get permission, we implemented a pop-up which requires the user to
agree to permit read contacts.
